Espresso Karol â€” A simple gui editor for [javakarol]
=====================================================

**Espresso Karol** is a simple gui editor for [javakarol], which can be used by
students who are only starting to learn Java and yet have problems to write whole
class structures.
It is written in java and uses [gradle] for building.


Features
-----------

* class tree of `ROBOTER` and `WELT` showing methods and constructors of these classes
* editor: syntax highlighting, line numbers, undo, redo
* error/output console
* automatic compilation and running of javakarol programs
* save and restore
* flexible configuration via modes and [EProperties] files [(manual)][eprops-man]
* gradle build and ecj: no dependencies except for a JRE


Dependencies
------------

* Java Runtime Environment 1.6 or 1.7
* [gradle] is installed by [gradlew]
* the rest is managed automatically by [gradle]


Usage
-----------

1. Build it with [gradle]/[gradlew].
2. Put it in your preferred installation directory.
3. Configure it: edit `espresso.props`, an EProperties file.
   A manual for EProperties files can be read [here][eprops-man].
   You can find a list of java system-properties [here][sys-props].
4. Run the start script:
    * UNIX: `bin/espresso`
    * Windows: `bin\espresso.bat`



Modes
-----------

In the default mode, only the body of the `main` method of a
javakarol program has to be written, but the preset parts of the class can be
configured by creating other modes.

All modes are located in the directory `modes` or `src/dist/modes`.
They are constituted of a directory whose name is the mode name, which contains three
files:

* `code`: An executable java class template. `// karolcode` is substituted by the
  javakarol code from the editor.
* `desc` (optional): A description for this mode which is displayed above the editor
  pane.
* `text` (optional): A default text that is automatically inserted in the editor pane.

For examples please have a look at the built-in modes.
